		<p> I am a senior research scientist in the <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/"> Google Brain Team </a> in Montr√©al. Previously, I spent a year at Geoffrey Hinton's amazing team in Google Brain, Toronto.</p>
<!--  		I also had a brief stint at Latent Logic (acquired by <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a>), a self-driving car startup in Oxford -->
		<p> My research work mainly revolves around deep reinforcement learning (RL), often with the goal of making RL methods suitable for real-world problems, and includes
		    an <a href="https://agarwl.github.io/rliable/">outstanding paper award</a> at NeurIPS.
